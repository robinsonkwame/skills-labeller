# skills-labeller
A WDI system for labelling and extracting skills within job postings. Implements an entire intelligent system utilizing a front end, pulling down job postings and online learning all under constrained system resources (e.g. EC2 micro/small) for ease of public use. This readme will be modified as the system continues to see development.
